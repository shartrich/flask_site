,"VOLCANO, Hawaii (AP) — The Latest on the eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii (all times local): 9:45 a.m. A new lava fissure has opened up on Hawaii's Big Island in the vicinity of a geothermal energy plant. The U.S. Geological Survey said minor lava spatter erupted from the new fissure Saturday morning, which brings the total number of fissures to 16. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reports the fissure opened 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) northeast of the last fissure and east of the Puna Geothermal Venture plant. No significant lava flow has been reported so far. Plant workers this week removed the 50,000 gallons of pentane stored at the site as a precaution. Geologists warn that the Kilauea volcano could shoot out large boulders and ash out of its summit crater.

,PARIS (AP) — The Latest on the Paris stabbing attack (all times local): 4:30 p.m. A judicial official says a friend of the young man who rampaged through a central Paris neighborhood knifing passers-by has been detained in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. The friend is the third person French police have taken in for questioning since the suspect in the Saturday night attack — a 20-year-old French citizen born in the Russian republic of Chechnya — killed one person and wounded four others. The parents of the alleged attacker were picked up in the northern 18th district of Paris after their son was fatally shot by police. The president of Chechnya identified the assailant as Khasan Azimov. The judicial official said the man detained Sunday was a friend of Azimov's who also was born in 1997. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and asked that he not be named. — by Elaine Ganley in Paris.,2018-05-13T14:40:54Z,associated-press,The Latest: Friend of Paris suspect detained for questioning,https://apnews.com/6acf1e4d7d024c50b0c8f6f187eaa4ea,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:2fe6f15adf534aaea65042844934e7f5/3000.jpeg,general,2018-05-13 15:27:52.709658

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON () - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping are working to give Chinese telecom company ZTE Corp ""a way to get back into business, fast."" ""President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.The Chinese technology company earlier this month suspended its main operations after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American supplies to its business. The ban is the result of ZTE's failure to comply with an agreement with the U.S. government after it pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran, the Commerce Department said.As one of the world’s largest telecom equipment makers, ZTE relied on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp for components.American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.

Suddenly, the windshield justcracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know, my co-pilothad been sucked halfway out of the window,"" he was quoted assaying.""Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most ofthe equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn't hear the radio.The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.""The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled backin.

Wagner fashions himself as a garbage man coming to clean up a state government that chokes the economy with regulations and taxes.

BERNARD CONDON and JONATHAN LEMIRE,"NEW YORK (AP) — A Chinese government-owned company has signed on to build a theme park in a vast development in Indonesia that also features a Trump hotel and condos, a deal that stands to benefit President Donald Trump's company just as top Chinese envoys head to Washington for trade talks. In a move that has alarmed Trump critics, an Indonesian company confirmed this week that it hired the subsidiary of the state-owned Metallurgical Corp. of China to build a theme park in its Lido City development outside Jakarta. The property owner three years earlier struck a deal for the development to include a Trump-branded hotel, 400 luxury villas and condos, and an 18-hole championship golf course.",2018-05-16T04:16:37Z,associated-press,Trump Indonesia project gets Chinese government partner,https://apnews.com/9d42998d79cb41ababc4b7e4837b87d9,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:931f8a5a4d334490b8898531f5a2a03c/3000.jpeg,general,2018-05-16 05:34:43.194819
RICHARD LARDNER,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyer Rudy Giuliani's decision to join President Donald Trump's legal team could backfire on the former New York mayor if potential clients of his international consulting business view him as too erratic and go elsewhere for representation, according to legal experts. Giuliani has become a lightning rod in the short time he's been in the president's corner leading an aggressive media blitz to fight back against accusations that could threaten Trump's presidency. He's stunned Trump's inner circle by making confusing and at times contradictory statements that could trigger even more legal and political headaches for the White House. Giuliani, for example, recently had to backpedal after he was quoted as saying that Trump had denied AT&amp;T's bid to purchase Time Warner for $85 billion.",2018-05-16T04:16:14Z,associated-press,Giuliani's media work for Trump may backfire on his business,https://apnews.com/5f63db64ffda4fd5b05b0645f41bd6e4,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:6b278e31a97e4d51b2015b1305820a0e/3000.jpeg,general,2018-05-16 05:34:43.194819
